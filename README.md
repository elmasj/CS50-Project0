# My First Project for CS50 Course
# I have made six pages in which the index page is a list that refers to other pages, in addition i googled how to create a navbar and i made a navbar as well, with custom css styling.
# The second page is a page with lists of places i wish to visit, where i have used odered lists to make the lists.
# The third place is the table of my family members where i have used custom css to give its styling, second table is the table of my friends with the same styling as the first one. the other four tables are made using bootstrap grid model, in addition i used bootstrap styling and i have added pictures inside the table cells to make it more challenging for me.
# The fourth page is the images page where i will upload some images of places i am willing to visit. I made it in form of table just so it would not be very boring.
# The fifth page is about SCSS styling and i have used SCSS nesting to make a div and within that div i have defined the paragraph green and the list red, the elements outside the div remain untouched.
# The sixth page i have used SCSS Inheritance to create the alert messages, albeit with my own styling i have used the methods explained in the tutorial and made the koala automaticaly compile the scss files so i do not have to do it everytime. ( amazing piece of advice.)
# Having read the requirements many times i believe i have completed the project.
# Would like to apreciate you for taking the time and giving us this oportunity to be learning from the best.
